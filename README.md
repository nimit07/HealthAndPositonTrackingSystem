# HealthAndPositonTrackingSystem

A wearable prototype to track the position and and the pulse rates of Soilder's over a wifi network.

In today’s world, enemy warfare is an important factor in any nation’s security. The national security mainly depends on army (ground), navy (sea),air­force (air).The important and vital role is played by the army soldiers.There are many concerns regarding the safety of these soldiers. As soon as any soldier enters the enemy lines, it is very important for the army base station to know the location as well as the health status of all soldiers. In our project, we have come up with an idea of tracking the position of the soldier as well as to give the health status of the soldier during war, which enables the army
personnel to plan the war strategies. By using the location sent by the GPS modem, the base station can understand the position of soldier, know their health status and can receive signal in any distress situation.

# Working Principle:

The soldier with the device in the battlefield will be monitored by base station using a web interface on the server PC. Soldier’s position will be continuously tracked and his pulse will be monitored. Soldier can press emergency switches in case of medical emergency, need for backup or any kind of distress situation.
